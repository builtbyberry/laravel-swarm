# Durable Execution

Use `dispatchDurable()` when a swarm needs checkpointed execution instead of a
single long-running queue job.

`queue()` remains the lightweight background mode. One queued job runs the
whole swarm.

`dispatchDurable()` is different. Laravel Swarm persists a durable cursor and
advances one sequential step per job.

## Choosing Between `queue()` And `dispatchDurable()`

Use `queue()` when the swarm is short-lived and one job is still a comfortable
fit for your workers and queue visibility settings.

Use `dispatchDurable()` when the workflow is long-running, production-critical,
or more expensive to replay from the beginning:

```php
use App\Ai\Swarms\ArticlePipeline;

$response = ArticlePipeline::make()->dispatchDurable([
    'topic' => 'Laravel queues',
    'audience' => 'intermediate developers',
    'goal' => 'blog outline',
]);

$response->runId;
```

Durable execution is sequential-only in this release.

Durable responses do not support `then()` or `catch()`. Durable runs are
event-driven. Listen to `SwarmCompleted` and `SwarmFailed` instead of
serializing callbacks into the queue payload.

`dispatchDurable()` still follows Laravel's pending-dispatch lifecycle. In
Tinker or other manual testing, holding onto the response keeps the first job
pending until the response object is released:

```php
$response = ArticlePipeline::make()->dispatchDurable([
    'topic' => 'Atomic lease test',
]);

$runId = $response->runId;

unset($response);
gc_collect_cycles();
```

## How Durable Runs Advance

Laravel Swarm persists durable execution state in the database and dispatches
one job for each swarm step.

Each durable step job:

- acquires a database lease for the run
- reloads the persisted run context
- executes the next sequential agent
- checkpoints the updated context, artifacts, and history
- dispatches the next step job, or marks the run complete

That gives retries and recovery a clear boundary. A retry re-runs the current
step. It does not replay the whole workflow.

## Pause, Resume, Cancel, And Recover

Laravel Swarm includes operator commands for durable runs:

```bash
php artisan swarm:pause <run-id>
php artisan swarm:resume <run-id>
php artisan swarm:cancel <run-id>
php artisan swarm:recover
```

`pause()` and `cancel()` are step-boundary controls. Laravel Swarm does not try
to hard-cancel an in-flight provider request.

`swarm:recover` is the safety net for stranded durable runs. Schedule it
frequently:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('swarm:recover')->everyFiveMinutes();
```

Treat recovery like workflow supervision, not like pruning. A stranded durable
run should not wait until tomorrow's maintenance window.

## Timeouts And Database Requirements

Durable execution keeps the existing swarm timeout as the overall workflow
deadline. Each durable step job also uses a dedicated step timeout and lease
window.

Configure the per-step lease window with `SWARM_DURABLE_STEP_TIMEOUT`. The
value must be a positive integer number of seconds:

```bash
SWARM_DURABLE_STEP_TIMEOUT=300
```

Durable execution requires the database-backed persistence stores and the
durable runtime table. It is intentionally not available with cache-backed
swarm persistence.

Before dispatching durable runs in an application, configure database
persistence and run the package migrations:

```bash
SWARM_PERSISTENCE_DRIVER=database

php artisan migrate
```

Then run a queue worker for the connection and queue used by your durable swarm
jobs:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Durable jobs still obey Laravel's queue worker and connection settings. Keep
the worker timeout and queue connection `retry_after` comfortably above the
longest expected provider call for one durable step. If the queue visibility
window is shorter than the provider call, another worker may see the job as
available before the current worker finishes.

Finally, schedule recovery so checkpointed durable runs are supervised if a
worker exits after saving state but before dispatching the next step:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('swarm:recover')->everyFiveMinutes();
```

Also schedule pruning so expired database persistence rows are removed:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('swarm:prune')->daily();
```

## Production Setup Checklist

Before using durable swarms in production, make the operational contract
explicit:

- use database-backed persistence and run the package migrations
- put durable swarms on a dedicated queue when the workflow is important or
  provider calls are slow
- schedule `swarm:recover` every few minutes
- schedule `swarm:prune` daily, or more often if retention windows are short
- keep the queue worker timeout above the longest expected durable step
- keep the queue connection `retry_after` above both the worker timeout and the
  `swarm.durable.step_timeout` value
- keep retention short for high-volume workflows
- keep capture settings conservative when prompts, outputs, context, or
  artifacts may contain regulated data

For a narrow production pilot, prefer sequential durable swarms with
lower-sensitivity data, a dedicated queue, short retention, and database growth
monitoring from day one. Parallel and hierarchical swarms remain supported, but
they have stricter container-resolution, concurrency, provider-rate-limit, and
cost constraints.

Durable recovery depends on the scheduler. If `swarm:recover` is not scheduled,
a run can stay `running` after a worker crashes or exits between checkpointing a
step and dispatching the next job. Manual recovery is possible with
`php artisan swarm:recover`, but production durable workflows should not depend
on a human noticing a stranded run.
